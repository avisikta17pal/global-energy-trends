# Data download files

Place your prepared dataset here so it can be downloaded directly from GitHub:

- merged.csv (required)
- global_aggregates.csv (optional)

Notes
- Keep files under 100 MB for GitHub regular hosting. For larger files, use Git LFS.
- The project README links to `assets/data/merged.csv` for a one-click download.
